Overview
The Google APIs Explorer is a tool that helps you explore various Google APIs interactively.
https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/

With the APIs Explorer, you can:
Browse quickly through available APIs and versions.
See methods available for each API and what parameters they support along with inline documentation.
Execute requests for any method and see responses in real time.
Make authenticated and authorized API calls.
Search across all services, methods, and your recent requests to quickly find what you are looking for.
The APIs Explorer uses its own API key whenever it makes a request. When you use the APIs Explorer to make a request, it displays the request syntax, which includes a placeholder labeled {YOUR_API_KEY}. If you want to make the same request in your application, you need to replace this placeholder with your own API key.

What you'll do

Create a Cloud Storage bucket.
Upload an image to Cloud Storage and make it public.
Make a request to the Vision API with that image.

Virtual Private Networks (VPN)

Overview
In this lab, you establish VPN tunnels between two networks in separate regions such that a VM in one network can ping a VM in the other network over its internal IP address.

Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

Create VPN gateways in each network

Create VPN tunnels between the gateways

Verify VPN connectivity

Tip 1:
For the purposes of this lab, the path from subnet-a to subnet-b is not the same as the path from subnet-b to subnet-a. You are using one tunnel to pass traffic in each direction. And if both tunnels are not established, you won't be able to ping the remote server on its internal IP address. The ping might reach the remote server, but the response can't be returned.

In practice, a single tunnel could be used with symmetric configuration. However, it is more common to have multiple tunnels or multiple gateways and VPNs for production work, because a single tunnel could be a single point of failure.

Tip 2:
External IP addresses that don’t fall under the Free Tier will incur a small cost. Also, as a general security best practice, it’s a good idea to use internal IP addresses where applicable and since you configured Cloud VPN you no longer need to communicate between instances using their external IP address.

Tip 3:
You won't be able to ssh to the server without external IP from Cloud Shell.
However, if Cloud IAP is configured, internal IP can be reachable from Cloud Shell.

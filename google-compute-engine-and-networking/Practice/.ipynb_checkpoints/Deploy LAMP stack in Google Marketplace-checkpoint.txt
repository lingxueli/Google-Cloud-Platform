Step 1: Use Cloud Marketplace to deploy a LAMP stack
In the GCP Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click Marketplace.

In the search bar, type LAMP. In the search results, click LAMP Certified by Bitnami. On the LAMP page, click Launch.

Click Deploy.

The status of the deployment appears in the console window: lampstack-1 is being deployed. 
When the deployment of the infrastructure is complete, the status changes to lampstack-1 has been deployed. 
After the software is installed, a summary of the details for the instance, including the site address, is displayed.

Step 2: Verify your deployment

When the deployment is complete, click the Site address link in the right pane.

Alternatively, you can click Visit the site in the Get started with LAMP Certified by Bitnami section of the page. A new browser tab displays a congratulations message. This page confirms that, as part of the LAMP stack, the Apache HTTP Server is running.

On the GCP Console, under Get started with LAMP Certified by Bitnami, click SSH. In a new window, a secure login shell session on your virtual machine appears.

In the just-created SSH window, to change the current working directory to /opt/bitnami, execute the following command:

cd /opt/bitnami

To copy the phpinfo.php script from the installation directory to a publicly accessible location under the web server document root, execute the following command:

sudo sh -c 'echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > apache2/htdocs/phpinfo.php'

The phpinfo.php script displays your PHP configuration. It is often used to verify a new PHP installation.

To close the SSH window, execute the following command:

exit

Open a new browser tab. Type the following URL, and replace SITE_ADDRESS with the URL in the Site address field in the right pane of the lampstack page.

http://SITE_ADDRESS/phpinfo.php

A summary of the PHP configuration of your server is displayed.
